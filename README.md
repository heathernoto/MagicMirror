# :mage_woman: Black Mirror Fortune Teller

This project was built for a bootcamp _StackAThon_.

When trying to come up with an idea for tech I hadn't yet explored, I was trying to think :nerd_face: of something fun that could start basic and add features later.

:grinning: Inspiration struck!

The idea was a simple fortune teller like the toy Magic \* Ball. :8ball:

I remember as a kid shaking the :8ball:until it gave me the answer that I wanted. What if I could use facial recognition to try and determine the spirit in which the question was asked? If it's something that excites you, puts a :smile: on your face- boom, the positive answer you wanted.

My thought that was, like the :8ball:, you would ask a question. Because I wanted the user to look into :camera: to ask the question, I began thinking of the phone's 'black mirror' quality and the magic mirror in Snow White. Black mirror magic..

This project was my first foray into :iphone: developement. I had never used React-Native, hooks or it's dev tools. (How do I console.log??) And the facial recognition didn't go that smoothly either. The first couple of libraries I tried I couldn't get to work with Native- leading me to Expo.

I'm so excited that it works. But there's definitely things that I will be looking to improve, tweak, update when I can come back to it. (I'd like to change it to a PWA so other people can run it.) I'm so excited to have learned soooo much AND to have something that works. I liked working on a mobile app and delving into React-Native.
