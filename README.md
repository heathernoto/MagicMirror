# :mage_woman: Black Mirror Fortune Teller :mage_man:

---

:nerd_face:When trying to come up with an idea for a Hack-A-Thon project, I wanted to have some fun. I was trying to think of something different that would allow me to try out something new.


Inspiration struck! :grinning:


:8ball: The idea was a simple fortune teller like the toy Magic 8 Ball.

I remember as a kid shaking the :8ball: until it gave me the answer that I wanted. What if I could use facial recognition to try and determine the spirit in which the question was asked? If it's something that excites you, puts a :smile: on your face- boom, the positive answer you wanted.  If it's something you're dreading, :frowning: it tells you what you want to hear!

My thought that was, like the Magic 8 Ball, you would ask a question. Because I wanted the user to look into the camera to ask the question, I began thinking of the phone's 'black mirror' quality and the magic mirror in Snow White. Black mirror magic..

This project was my first foray into mobile development. I had never used React-Native, hooks or it's dev tools. (How do I console.log??) And the facial recognition took sometime to fit together at first. The first couple of libraries I tried I couldn't get to work with Native- leading me to Expo.

&nbsp;

I'm so excited that it works. But there's definitely things that I will be looking to improve, tweak, update when I can come back to it. (I'd like to change it to a PWA so other people can run it.) I'm so excited to have learned soooo much AND to have something that works. I liked working on a mobile app and delving into React-Native.
