Black Mirror Fortune Teller

This project was built for a bootcamp StackAThon.  When trying to come up with an idea that stretched me, I was trying to think of something fun that could start basic and add features later.

The idea was a simple fortune teller like a Magic 8 ball.  I remember as a kid shaking the Magic 8 Ball until it gave me the answer that I wanted. What if I could use facial recognition to try and determine the spirit in which the question was asked?  If it's some that excited you, puts a smile on your face- boom, the positive answer you wanted.

My thought that was, like the 8 Ball, you would ask a question.  Because I wanted the user to look into camera to ask the question,  I began thinking of the phone's 'black mirror' quality and the magic mirror in Snow White. Black Mirror Magic..

This project was my first foray into mobile developement. I had never used React-Native, hooks or it's dev tools.  (How do I console .log??) And the facial recognition didn't go that smoothly either.  The first couple of libraries I tried I couldn't get to work with Native- leading me to Expo.

I'm so excited that it works. (Almost all the time!) But there's definitely things that I will be looking to improve, tweak, update when I can come back to it.  I'm so excited to have learned soooo much AND to have something that works. Even in a simplistic way.
